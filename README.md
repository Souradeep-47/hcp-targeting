## Introduction

The HCP Targeting Dashboard is a powerful, data-driven web application designed to help pharmaceutical sales representatives turn complex IQVIA claims data into actionable sales intelligence. By parsing weekly CSV files, the app provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of Health Care Provider (HCP) activity, identifies key opportunities, and uses AI to generate hyper-personalized talking points for more effective sales calls.

This tool was built to bridge the gap between raw data and strategic outreach, enabling reps to work smarter, not harder.

## Key Features

-   **Intuitive Data Visualization**: Transforms dense CSV claims data into beautiful, easy-to-read cards for each HCP.
-   **Advanced Filtering**: Quickly segment and filter HCPs by Therapy Area, company, and product focus.
-   **AI-Powered Talking Points**: Leverages Google's Gemini API to generate hyper-personalized, compliant talking points tailored to each HCP's prescribing habits.
-   **Actionable Insights**: At-a-glance KPIs highlight patient volume, new patient share, and top-prescribed drugs.
-   **Smart Prioritization**: Badges automatically flag HCPs with recent or upcoming patient appointments, helping you focus your efforts where they'll have the most impact.
-   **Personalized UI**: A sleek, "Liquid Glass" interface with customizable themes to match your preference.
-   **Data Export**: Easily export your filtered insights back to a CSV file for offline use or reporting.
-   **Self-Contained & Secure**: No backend or database required. All data processing happens securely in your browser.
